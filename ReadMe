wifiHarvester is a Python script which gathers information about the saved Wi-Fi profiles on the system the program is executed on.

Available in this repository is the .py source code file and an executable file which can be run on a system without Python installed.
Both the executable and the .py file can be run from a USB drive, and will save the exported information to a text file located in the
same folder using the host name of the system.

The program collects the following information:

-	Wi-Fi Network SSID
-	Network Password, if saved in the profile
-	MAC Randomization Indicator
-	Connection Mode Indicator
-	SSID Count

The Wi-Fi SSID is important to identify the network in question.  Additionally, if the password
for the connection is saved in the systemâ€™s profiles, this will also be collected.  MAC
Randomization enables an examiner to determine if the connection potentially had difference MAC
addresses when the system was connected.  The connection mode indicates if the connection could
be accomplished automatically, or if a user needed to make the connection manually.  SSID Count
indicates if that network connection had more than one SSID associated with that connection.
